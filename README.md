# QA-Automation-Framework
Welcome to A29! As students of the TestPro bootcamp we as Automation engineers are working with CI/CD to build a framework that tests major functionalities of Koel. Koel is a web app music interface that allows its user to enjoy music from the web. We students have conducted manual and automated tests to get a better grasp of becoming Automation Engineers in the near Future!

"Koel needs Java in order to sing". :)
