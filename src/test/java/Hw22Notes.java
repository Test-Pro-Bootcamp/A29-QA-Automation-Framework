        /* POM Page Object Design Pattern models are of a UI as objects
        within test code which can also be considered as Object Repository
        for Web Ui Elements.
        The functionality classes (PageObject) in this design represents a
        logical relationship between the pages of the application.
        Each class is referred to as a PageObjects and returns other
        PageObjects to facilitate the flow between pages.
        Page object class is responsible to find the WebElements of
        that page and also hold methods which perform operations on those WebElements.

        Denis -- As an internet user you need to know page address and browser that navigates there.
        Since it is OOP we will declare an object to interact with.
        Objects will stand for an actual page opened in an actual browser
        (Sometimes we need to know browsers at the same time for admin-user interaction)
        So we need different object
        -- As you know classes have two things - fields(properties) and methods(actions). For us every page
        will have both - fields are mostly elements and methods are actions that pages offer.
